INTRODUCTION TO HTML
~WHAT IS HTML?

* HTML is a versatile language that is used in websites, apps, and various software to deliver a wide range of content, such as text, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences.
* It acts as a foundation for all things digital, ensuring that different types of information can be effectively communicated and understood by both humans and computers.
* HTML helps bridge the gap between human and computer languages, making it easier for computers to comprehend and interact with human activities on the web.

<Core Web technologies or languages>

HTML 
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the three programming languages that make up the web. 
* HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is responsible for structuring the content of a website and providing access to browser functionalities. 
* Unlike other programming languages, HTML is declarative and focuses on making simple declarations rather than complex logic.
* Its simplicity allows it to be resilient and robust, even in the face of errors or missing elements. 
* HTML can still deliver a functional result by guessing and fixing any issues it encounters.

CSS
* CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a tricky web tool responsible for styling web pages with colors, fonts, and sizes. 
* Its computer science side makes it both fragile and powerful, with browsers being smart enough to skip hiccups and make most of it work.

JavaScript 
* JavaScript is a powerful programming language that enables the creation of interactive content on websites. 
* It surpasses the capabilities of HTML and CSS, but can be fragile if outdated browsers or outdated computers fail to understand the code.
* The Web is a  unique software that operates on various platforms and devices, enabling content sharing across different devices.
* To achieve this, the Web relies on three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
* Developers combine these languages to achieve resilience, robustness, and power in their websites. 
* HTML is preferred for tasks that can be done in HTML, while other languages are used for more complex tasks.


TEXT FORMATTING

~Html syntax 
* HTML is a web page structure language that uses tags enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols to mark elements, with two types: opening and closing tags.
* HTML elements, like paragraphs, are defined by tags that work together to provide meaning to content. 
* HTML markup helps computers understand and interpret content, serving as a bridge between humans and computers. 
* An example of this is a paragraph with emphasized text, wrapped in p tags and nested within em tags.

~Paragraph 
* For the browser to recorgnize the paragraph we use an opening and closing <p> tag before the first paragraph and a closing </p> tag at the end.

~Headlines
* Web pages use titles, headlines, and subheadings to divide long text into smaller chunks, aiding comprehension. Headlines on landing pages serve as clickable titles, leading readers to further information.
* Headlines in HTML come in six types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.
* Each has a distinct visual effect and hierarchy. 
* The largest is h1, while the smallest is h6. 
* Selecting the appropriate headline level is straightforward, starting with the opening tag<h2> and ending with the closing tag</h2>.
* The choice of headline level is based on its meaning, with h1 serving as the main title and h2 as a subheading.
* Hierarchical headlines provide meaning to the browser and ensure consistency for screen reader users.
* For semantic hierarchy you have to make use of this elements.

~Bold and italic 
* The use of italics or bold in book publishing, journalism, and magazine production adheres to specific rules to ensure correctness.
* The use of italics in HTML is to make a strong point and emphasize something.
* The "<i>" element is used to apply visual italics, while the "<em>" element adds emphasis. 
* These elements serve different purposes, communicating semantic and human meaning. 
* The "<strong>" element is used to show importance, seriousness, or urgency, while the "<b>" element is more generic and neutral, allowing for bold visuals without implying any alternative voice .
* It is crucial not to use only one element for everything, as their effects on the listener or reader can vary depending on the context.
* HTML has four elements for bolding or italicizing text: "<em>" and "<strong>," which carry a meaning, and "<i>" and "<b>," which are used for styling.

~HTML lists
* The browser has essential list but sometimes you may notice them because they are not displayed as traditional lists.
* In HTML, there are three types of lists: unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists. 

     <unordered list >
  * Unordered lists are commonly used in web design, with each item enclosed in an <li> element.
  * The entire list is wrapped in an <ul> element, representing an unordered list.
  * When displayed on browser it appears in bullet points or marker.
  * The <ul> element defines to the browser what type of list to display and the list appearance can be changed using CSS.

     <ordered list >
  * The ordered list is a type of list with a specific order, unlike the unordered list. 
  * It uses <ol> to wrap items, indicating a clear order. For example, a recipe can be created with numbered steps.

     <definition list>
  * A definition list in HTML is a key-value pair in computer science, consisting of terms and their corresponding descriptions.
  * It uses specific elements, such as <dt> element for terms and <did> element descriptions, and is wrapped in a <dl> element, representing the entire list. 
  * Multiple descriptions can be added, and the tags are placed side by side.

~HTML quotes 

    <block quote>
* The  <cite> and <blockqoute> elements serve semantic purposes to other computers to inform that the paragraph is quoted.
* This elements allow custom styling using CSS .
* The blockquote element can contain any element, including paragraphs, lists, or headlines, but it's crucial to ensure elements are nested within each other in a meaningful manner.

    < in-line quotes >
* The "<q>" element in HTML is used for inline quotes
* it automatically provides the appropriate quote marks for different languages. 
* Inline elements like <q> are used within a line and they wrap around inline phrases of text.
* Block-level elements like block quotes create separate blocks on the page. 

     <date time>
Date element
* The datetime attribute in HTML allows us to specify a date or time in a machine-readable format
* The format must be specific, starting with the year, followed by the month and date. Examples include '2025-05-08'

Time element
* The time element is a crucial element in web pages,can be used to  indicate time in a highly standardized format. 
* It writes the time in a machine-readable version, including 24-hour clock numbers, seconds, and fractions of a second. 
* It also allows specifying the time zone, eg New York City's time zone.
* The datetime attribute allows for the combination of date and time, with options for separating them using a T or space. 
* This format is acceptable in various programming languages and can be used in various combinations, ensuring time is easily understood by computers.

~HTML code
    <code elements>
* To showcase code on a webpage, use the code element with an opening code tag <code> before the snippet and a closing code tag </code>afterward.
* This will display a less than sign  â€œ&lt;" and  "&gt;" will display a greater than sign.
* They help display HTML code on a page instead of executing.
* These are known as HTML entity.

    <bre element>
* The br and pre elements are used to add spaces and line breaks to code without affecting the webpage's content.
* For example, if a poem needs to be displayed properly on a webpage, the br element can be added at the end of each line to indicate where a line break should occur. 
* This simple tag <br> does not have a closing tag.

    <pre element >
* For a  poem that  uses irregular spacing to enhance its meaning we is pre element to display it as it is 
* We add <pre> tag at the beginning of the poem </pre> at the and of the poem. 
* The browser respects spacing, line breaks, and even inserts a random character.
* Pre and code elements are combined to display a code block with proper indentation. 
* CSS code is included, wrapped in a code element to indicate a block of code, and wrapped in a pre element to preserve formatting and spacing.

~HTML Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text

* Subscripts, superscripts, and small text are used to mark specific content with different meanings. 
* Subscripts are characters set below the text's normal baseline, like the formula for water, while superscripts are characters set above the text's normal baseline.
* Mathematical formulas and footnotes use superscripts, like five squared. 
* To mark subscripts and superscripts in HTML, use <sub> and <sup> elements. 
* For example, H2O can be formatted as H2O, with the sub-element reducing and the sup element increasing and decreasing.
* MathML is a powerful markup language for complex equations on websites.
* However, small text, such as copyright information, can still be included in a footer with little prominence. 
* To convey this, a small element is used.
* CSS can adjust the size of text to be large or small.
* Small is correct for conveying small meaning, like strong for importance. 
* For example, the fine print at the bottom of a page regarding ownership can be displayed as "It is not the main attraction."
* Small, sub, and sup elements are crucial in typography for accurately conveying content's full meaning.

CAPABILITIES

~Troubleshooting and Debugging HTML Code

* We can examine HTML in browser developer tools, such as Firefox, to understand a website's code and performance, providing valuable insights into its functionality.

          <HTML debugging code>
     * To access developer tools,opt to go to "tools," then "web developer," and choose "inspector."
          <HTML debugging code>
     * The inspector offers a range of tabs with various tools or controls. 
     * Focus on the left pane, which displays HTML and CSS, and the right pane for layout tools, like CSS changes, and font information.
     * The left pane displays the browser's DOM, attempting to correct any mistakes made during the process.
     * The inspector displays the DOM tree, useful for inspecting websites. 

          <Using browser DevTools inspector>
     * Popular browsers like Safari, Chrome, and Edge have similar developer tools with similar indentation and triangles.

          <Reviewing broken code>
     * The problematic code displays an unordered list with four items, incorrectly numbered one, two, three, four. 
     * The developer tools reveal that the browser is adding extra tags during the DOM tree build, causing the incorrect count. 
     * To fix this, add a missing slash before the third item, and use the developer tools to resolve the issue.

~HTML attributes 

* HTML is complex and offers additional capabilities through attributes, adding power to any element. 
* Some attributes are specific to elements like time, while others work with multiple elements, like images and videos, as discussed.

          <Using Global Attributes>
     * The class attribute in HTML is a widely used global attribute that assigns a reusable name to any element, allowing it to be styled using CSS.

          <Class and ID A ttributes>
     * Class and ID attributes are essential for naming HTML elements and referencing them in other parts of the code stack.
     * They can be used for CSS targeting but are more specific, causing issues.
     * IDs are useful for addressing specific JavaScript elements or targeted links.
     * In a demo, classes and IDs were used to create a table of contents with links to corresponding ID elements.
     * HTML attributes enhance user interaction and provide browser power. 
     * Content editable attributes allow interaction with screen, keyboard, and assistive devices. 
     * The "lang" attribute specifies language of content using a short code, while the "dir" attribute indicates text flow direction.
     * These attributes are Global Attributes and can be used on any HTML element.

~ARIA Roles

* ARIA Roles enhance the understanding of HTML elements, allowing users to better comprehend their content. 
* However, sometimes these roles must be compromised to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities
* HTML plays a crucial role in human rights.

          <Web or online Accessibility>
     * ARIA roles ensure website accessibility for assistive technologies like screen readers, braille displays, and magnifiers, ensuring full functionality of complex interfaces in apps.

          <Using the browser accessibility tree>
     * The accessibility tree,is like a component of the DOM tree, is essential for assistive devices like screen readers to improve user experience.
     * It treats content as separate text containers, potentially causing poor reading.
     * To improve accessibility, add an ARIA label to HTML and hide individual letters within a div element.
     * This enhances web accessibility and is beneficial for teams working with semantic HTML or complex application interfaces. 
     * ARIA Roles provide necessary tools for making a site accessible to everyone.

~Formatting HTML 

          < Working with spaces>
     * HTML files have various formatting options, but they generally don't pay much attention to spaces, tabs, or line breaks. 
     * However, using elements like <pre>, <code>, or <textarea> or adjusting whitespace handling with CSS can affect extra spaces.
     * The browser often ignores the extra space around the paragraph 

          < Working with comments on HTML>
     * Programmers improve code readability by adding comments explaining its purpose. 
     * HTML comments are ignored by browsers. 
     * Code editors like Notepad++ display commented code in a grayed-out format, preventing confusion and identifying code comments.

          < Working with lower and upper case>
     * The debate over uppercase versus lowercase in HTML has evolved over time, with some websites still using all-caps HTML and others using lowercase. 
     * Despite this, browser support remains consistent, with lowercase becoming the norm.

          <Working with short and long elements in HTML>
     * HTML elements' lengths vary due to their creation in the late 80s and early 90s.
     * Initially, HTML was designed to optimize file size due to limited resources. 
     * As technology advanced, it prioritized code readability and understandability, leading to newer elements using complete words instead of abbreviations. 
     * The element's length also indicates its existence.

          <Working with self-closing elements in html>
     * HTML elements typically have an opening and closing tag, with newer elements like video elements having both.
     * Older elements, like image elements, have no closing tag. 
     * In the 90s, a slash was added to elements without a closing tag, but it became less important in 2010. 
     * Browsers now accept various formatting options.

~Unusual Characters

* Symbols like <, >, and & are crucial in HTML.
* When written with spaces, these symbols appear as regular content. 
* Content management systems like WordPress and markdown handle these characters, but some users may need to handle them themselves.

          <Coding formatting in HTML>
     * HTML entities, such as ampersand, short code, and semicolon, are used to convert characters into specific ones in HTML files. 
     * The W3C provides a reference chart for these entities, and they can be used to type characters not available on a keyboard, such as copyright symbols.

          <Using non-breaking spaces>
* Non-breaking space in text allows lines to break and words to remain intact, while browsers search for suitable spaces with gaps between words for full sentences.
* Non-breaking spaces in HTML allow the browser to maintain a line between two words, ensuring they remain on the same line. 
* They can also be used to create multiple spaces between words, allowing for multiple sentences. 
* These HTML character entities ensure specific characters are displayed on the webpage, allowing for more effective and efficient web design.

HTML NAVIGATION AND LINKING

~HTML links 
* Web links, a concept introduced by computer innovators in the 1980s, have become the norm in online navigation and information sharing. 
* The fascination with hypertext, hypermedia, and hyperlinks persisted for over 20 years, leading to the birth of the web. 
* Although creating a link is simple, its profound impact on computing and the modern world is evident.

          <Working with links>
     * To create a link in HTML, use the A element (anchor) and an href attribute with a URL enclosed in quotes.
     * The href stands for Hypertext Reference. 
     * Link elements can be inline, wrapped around text, images, or complex elements. 
     * Absolute URLs, which point to a precise location on the web, can be included without a trailing slash. 
     * The HTTPS part, or Hypertext Transport Protocol, defines web communication rules. 
     * HTTPS stands for Secure, and modern browsers automatically add the HTTPS:// part when typing example.com.
     * Both HTTP and HTTPS are essential for web security.

~HTML url pathways 

* Absolute URLs are only one option for forming links, but relative URLs can be used when linking to something within the same site and domain as the page containing the link. 
* For example, if a website is launched at http://www.awesomedogs.com, all links should point to the local copy of the files, while links on a testing server should direct to the files on that server. 
* Relative URLs are useful for referencing image, video, CSS, JavaScript files, and other file paths.

          <Creating URLs from scratch>
     * To create a URL, understand file organization and file extensions.
     * For example, to link to a blog post, use "blog" and "March-9.html". 
     * Slashes indicate deeper file structure. 
     * To create a relative URL, omit the domain name but include the initial slash at the beginning, starting from the root level. 
     * Alternatively, write the path relative to the file.

          <Creating local URLs>
     * URLs work by creating relative and absolute links.
     * For example, a URL pointing to the logo.gif file in the images folder can be written as /images/logo.gif or../images/logo.gif.
     * The ".." followed by a slash indicates going up one level in the directory structure.
     * In web development, browsers automatically load an index.html file when given a URL pointing to a folder. 
     * This method works for HTML files, not images or CSS.
     * Crafting well-structured URLs for web pages is an art, considering user experience and search engine results. 
     * Relative URLs are helpful for projects moving between servers, while absolute URLs start from the website's root. 
     * Using folders and index.html files creates user-friendly URLs.

~Navigation 
          <main navigation>
     * To create a site's navigation menu, wrap each link in a URL-enclosed list, wrap it in an unordered list, and wrap it in a nav element.
     * Apply CSS styling to make it visually appealing and understandable to screen readers and assistive devices. 
     * Assign the role of navigation to the nav element and include an aria label for easy reading.
          <Breadcrumbs>
     * A breadcrumb trail is a menu with links wrapped in an ordered list, providing context when read aloud, and not assigned navigation role.
          <Footer links>
     * Focus on links in the footer of a page, not part of the site's navigation.
     * Mark each link as a link and wrap them in a "footer" element, without a nav or unordered list. 
     * Consider actions and layer semantic meaning for projects.

WORKING WITH GRAPHICS AND IMAGES

~Images
* To add the images to the web we use image element (IMG).

          <image elemement>
     * Each image should have four attributes: source attribute (SRC), alt attribute (ALT), width and height attribute (Wh), which determine the image file, text description, and size, respectively.

          <Working with image element>
     * The image URL is pasted into the source, and the image loads. 
     * ALT attribute is added to replace the image when it's not visible. 
     * The ALT text should be interesting, use humor or poetic language, or leave it blank if there's nothing significant to convey.

          <Working with blank ALT text>
     * The example were a company name  and logo have repeative words.
     * The ALT text is added and left blank to prevent the image file name from being read aloud. 
     * The browser needs to know the image's dimensions in pixels, such as 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.
     * The width and height attributes are included to verify these dimensions.
     * You can place the attributes within an element in any order you like  . 
     * The width and height attributes are necessary because the browser determines how to display the image by downloading it, analyzing its characteristics, and using that information to calculate the layout. 
     * This helps prevent page shifting during image loading, improving user experience.

~Image formats

* The image file is crucial for webpages, requiring a web browser-friendly format. 
* New formats aim to balance small file sizes with visually stunning images, ensuring fast downloads and minimizing data usage. 
* Each format uses unique compression techniques to achieve the highest quality with the smallest possible size.

     GIV
* GIFs compress large, color-saturated illustrations but may not be suitable for photographs due to limited color support and potential pixelation, and may cause jagged edges between transparent and solid parts.

     SVG
* SVGs are vector files suitable for logos, icons, and illustrations, with instructions for drawing rather than individual pixels. 
* They can be scaled without loss of quality and can be exported from programs like Illustrator or Sketch.

     JPG
* JPGs are commonly used for compressing images and should be resized when placed on the web.
* The web sites should avoid using large, half-compressed JPGs cause they slow the loading speed. 
* To further compress JPG, need reduce color information and find the right balance between quality and file size.

     PNG
* PNG is a transparent format that outperforms GIF and JPG in compressing images. 
* It's recommended to experiment with different compression options and keep an eye out for future image formats with improved compression capabilities.

~Responsive Images
* CSS can display images in different sizes for large and small screens, but it can be problematic for users with slow network connections or limited data plans.
* Reducing image size, reducing colored data, and compressing them can work for smaller screens, but it may result in low-quality images for larger monitors.

          <Responsive image scr set file format>
     * HTML allows for the delivery of different image files to screens of different sizes.
     * To load an image, create multiple copies with different resolutions and inform the browser about these options. 
     * The device can choose which image to use based on factors like screen density, network connection, and user settings. 
     * To handle different image sizes for retina and high DPI screens, add a source set attribute to the HTML code.
     * This attribute lists the images on offer, separated by commas, with each entry including a URL to the file, resolution, and so on. 
     * The browser will swap out one version of the image for another based on what it considers best.

~Responsive Width

          <responsive image scr set width>
     * The src set attribute in HTML specifies the width of each file, not the pixel density. 
     * This allows the browser to decide which image to show based on device density and viewport width, potentially causing issues if the chosen image doesn't fit the desired layout. 
     * To improve the choice, the sizes attribute in HTML can specify the image to use at different breakpoints, allowing the browser to download the right-sized image for the layout.

~Responsive Pictures
* The source set in the sizes attribute can offer multiple image files to the browser, allowing it to decide which one to load and display. 

          <responsive image size>
     * Is used for displaying images differently on small screens, such as tall and narrow on mobile devices and short and wide on desktop computers, or using a different photo altogether.

          <Responsive image and pictures element>
     * The picture element is a useful tool for optimizing images on the web. 
     * It allows for the display of different screen sizes, allowing for better focus on specific areas.
     * The image element, with its ALT text and URL, ensures compatibility with older browsers. 
     * The picture element, wrapped with the image element, provides alternative options using the source element. 
     * Two source elements are used: one for mobile images, a cropped version sized at 320 pixels wide, and another for larger screens, a landscape version sized at 600 pixels wide. 
     * This allows for optimization for different screen sizes. The browser switches between files based on the viewport size and retina screen, using the larger version only when necessary. 
     * This optimization process saves users time and data, as the image files range from 27k to 593k, saving up to three megabytes of data per photo. 
     * Overall, using these HTML techniques optimizes images on the web while delivering beautiful, scalable images.

~Figcation and figures

          <Working with figures and Figcation element>
     * To create a visually appealing image, use the figcaption element to wrap the text and designate it as a caption. 
     * Place the image and caption together in a figure element(<figure> </figure>), this provides more information about the content and also shows the seach engines that they are connected. 
     * These elements are useful for interactive graphics and concept demonstrations.

HTML WORKING WITH MEDIA

~Working With Media

          <Working With Audio>
     * The audio element is not like the image element.
     * This element has an opening and closing tag for modernity and flexibility, and uses a source attribute to provide the audio file URL.

          <Audio element>
     * The are many audio format that we can use and MP3 is one of the them
     * To make use of browser controls like play button, timeline, and volume control, we have to add the control attribute on the audio element.

          <Working with the audio element>
     * The audio element in HTML can be created using JavaScript and the HTML media element API. 
     * Control attribute allows users to play, pause, adjust volume, view time, and navigate through the timeline.
     * The are other attributes that can be used with the audio element, such as "loop" and "Autoplay". 
     * The audio element has an opening and closing tag to specify multiple audio files, similar to the picture element. 
     * This can be helpful if a new file format is not supported in all browsers while providing a fallback for older ones. 
     * Creating multiple files and listing them in separate source elements ensures compatibility with different browsers.

~Working With Video
* The web has revolutionized the way we connect and share content, including movies, TV shows, and teaching . 
* The HTML video element, with its opening '<video>' and closing tags'</video>', allows for easy video display on web pages and automatic player creation.

          <Working with the video element>
     * Video encoding is a crucial aspect of internet video transmission, as it compresses large data into smaller packages. 
     * Various codecs have been developed over the years, including H.264, which is proprietary and not open source. 
     * The WebM versus AV1 debate remains uncertain, with AV1 potentially being the superior codec and free of royalty charges. 
     * HTML allows for the simultaneous use of multiple codecs, including H.264, WebM, and AV1. 
     * However, HTML lacks a built-in mechanism for sending different video sizes based on network conditions.
     * Major streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, and Vimeo use adaptive bitrate streaming to ensure seamless switching between different resolutions. 
     * Websites often use embed codes from video hosting services to simplify the process and leverage the capabilities provided by these services. 
     * This choice is often made to leverage the capabilities provided by these services.

~Working With Captions and Subtitles
* Audio and video content on websites can be accessible to everyone, but not everyone can always hear or understand it due to factors like hearing loss or difficulty with accents or fast pace. 
* The web provides multiple ways to provide content simultaneously.

          <Working with the video captions and the track element>
     * To add captions to a video, use the track element and link it to a text file. 
     * This allows viewers to toggle captions on and off or switch between different subtitle options. 
     * The web video uses this text tracks file format (ibvtt). 
     * Can dispalay captions on the video by insertig a track element within the video element, specifying the file, kind attribute, label attribute, source lang attribute, and default attribute . 
     * A captioning icon appears, allowing users to turn captions off, enable automatic captioning, or select English captions.
     * Other options include "descriptions" for visual elements and "chapters" for different sections.
     * Platforms like YouTube and Vimeo allow uploading caption files, making content more accessible and increasing audience base. 
     * Captions and subtitles are powerful and often required by law, making content more accessible and boosting traffic.

~Embedding Media via Iframes
* Embedding is the process of placing content from one site into another's page, allowing for a variety of content to be displayed. 
* It's common to embed complex content from a service that handles technical aspects, reducing the need for complex website development. 
* However, HTML knowledge is required for this process.

          <Getting an embed link from Youtube>
     * YouTube engineers have simplified HTML, but understanding HTML can help recognize iframe elements with adjustable attributes like height and width.
     * However, security issues must be considered when importing code from other websites.

          <Working with the iFrame element>
     * Content management systems like WordPress and Drupal may restrict embed codes from other websites. 
     * Consider security for iframe elements when building a website. 
     * Allow only one iframe if multiple users add content, but not all if only one user posts videos.

~HTML Content Identification

         <HTML Language Support >

* The internet supports various languages, and HTML tools help indicate content language. 
* Search engines understand, spell checkers provide dictionaries, and computers understand content language for accurate pronunciation.

       lANG ATTRIBUTE
* The lang attribute specifies the language of a webpage, typically on the HTML element that wraps all other elements. 
* It is essential for spell checkers and other purposes. 
* The lang attribute can indicate regional versions of a language or other qualities like the writing system used. 
* If a webpage has multiple languages, specify the language for each part of the content using the lang attribute on any element.
* The dir attribute indicates the content's direction, which can be applied to any element.

The Meta Attribute

* Set the charset for your project, which is the set of characters or alphabet used by each language. 
* Previously, computer character sets were limited, mainly focused on the Latin alphabet. *Today, Unicode, particularly UTF-8, is widely used, encoding content for a wide range of characters, scripts, and emojis. 
* To specify the charset in HTML, include a meta charset tag equal to UTF-8 within the head element on every page. 
* This contributes to a more inclusive web future.

~HTML Generic Elements, Div and Span
*HTML elements like div and span are useful when an element doesn't exist, such as grouping or highlighting phrases or targeting specific parts of the DOM with CSS or Javascript, even if there's no real meaning behind it.

    <The div and span elements>
* Before HTML5, divs and spans were used extensively for creating sections and sidebars.
* However, excessive use of these elements is not recommended as it negatively affects users. 
* It is recommended to use appropriate HTML elements for specific purposes. 
* Generic elements like divs and spans are needed when necessary, as they do not function until CSS or Javascript is applied.

     <Working with Div and Span Elements>
* A simple article with a headline and four paragraphs can be grouped using CSS to add a background color to the paragraphs. 
* To target a specific phrase, use the inline element span. Both div and span can use global attributes like class, id, lang, and aria roles. 
* They are useful last resort options when other options are unavailable.

~HTML Integration
 <HTML Page>
* HTML, including elements, attributes, roles, and tools, is crucial for markup on websites and web apps. 
* It plays a significant role in explaining content and is sent back by the web server when a URL is entered, triggering a web browser or view.

   <Standard HTML page head>
* In the early days of the web, all necessary files for a webpage were contained in a single HTML file. 
* Today, the web process involves users visiting a URL, requesting an HTML file, and the server returning a single file.
* The browser reads the file and follows its instructions, requesting additional files as needed.
* This process ensures that a web page is generated quickly and efficiently, allowing users to access and interact with the content.

   <Structure of the whole HTML file>
* The HTML file structure is crucial for web pages. 
* It begins with a doctype statement, indicating the era of the file. 
* The HTML element, containing all content, is enclosed within an HTML element.
* The page's language and content flow direction are specified at the beginning. 
* The HTML element consists of a head and body, with the head containing metadata for the browser, and the body for content.
* These elements are the essential building blocks of every web page.
