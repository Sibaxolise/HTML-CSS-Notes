INTRODUCTION TO HTML
<h2>WHAT IS HTML?</h2>

* HTML is a versatile language that is used in websites, apps, and various software to deliver a wide range of content, such as text, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences.
* It acts as a foundation for all things digital, ensuring that different types of information can be effectively communicated and understood by both humans and computers.
* HTML helps bridge the gap between human and computer languages, making it easier for computers to comprehend and interact with human activities on the web.

<Core Web technologies or languages>

HTML 
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the three programming languages that make up the web. 
* HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is responsible for structuring the content of a website and providing access to browser functionalities. 
* Unlike other programming languages, HTML is declarative and focuses on making simple declarations rather than complex logic.
* Its simplicity allows it to be resilient and robust, even in the face of errors or missing elements. 
* HTML can still deliver a functional result by guessing and fixing any issues it encounters.

CSS
* CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a tricky web tool responsible for styling web pages with colors, fonts, and sizes. 
* Its computer science side makes it both fragile and powerful, with browsers being smart enough to skip hiccups and make most of it work.

JavaScript 
* JavaScript is a powerful programming language that enables the creation of interactive content on websites. 
* It surpasses the capabilities of HTML and CSS, but can be fragile if outdated browsers or outdated computers fail to understand the code.
* The Web is a  unique software that operates on various platforms and devices, enabling content sharing across different devices.
* To achieve this, the Web relies on three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
* Developers combine these languages to achieve resilience, robustness, and power in their websites. 
* HTML is preferred for tasks that can be done in HTML, while other languages are used for more complex tasks.


TEXT FORMATTING

~Html syntax 
HTML is a web page structure language that uses tags enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols to mark elements, with two types: opening and closing tags.
HTML elements, like paragraphs, are defined by tags that work together to provide meaning to content. 
HTML markup helps computers understand and interpret content, serving as a bridge between humans and computers. 
An example of this is a paragraph with emphasized text, wrapped in p tags and nested within em tags.
Paragraph 
For the browser to recorgnize the   paragraph we use an opening and closing <p> tag before the first paragraph and a closing </p> tag at the end.

Headlines
Web pages use titles, headlines, and subheadings to divide long text into smaller chunks, aiding comprehension. Headlines on landing pages serve as clickable titles, leading readers to further information.
Headlines in HTML come in six types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.
 Each has a distinct visual effect and hierarchy. 
The largest is h1, while the smallest is h6. 
Selecting the appropriate headline level is straightforward, starting with the opening tag<h2> and ending with the closing tag</h2>.
The choice of headline level is based on its meaning, with h1 serving as the main title and h2 as a subheading.
Hierarchical headlines provide meaning to the browser and ensure consistency for screen reader users.
For semantic hierarchy you have to make use of this elements.
Bold and italic 
The use of italics or bold in book publishing, journalism, and magazine production adheres to specific rules to ensure correctness.
The use of italics in HTML is to make a strong point and emphasize something.
 The "<i>" element is used to apply visual italics, while the "<em>" element adds emphasis. 
These elements serve different purposes, communicating semantic and human meaning. 
The "<strong>" element is used to show importance, seriousness, or urgency, while the "<b>" element is more generic and neutral, allowing for bold visuals without implying any alternative voice .
 It is crucial not to use only one element for everything, as their effects on the listener or reader can vary depending on the context.
HTML has four elements for bolding or italicizing text: "<em>" and "<strong>," which carry a meaning, and "<i>" and "<b>," which are used for styling.

HTML lists
The browser has essential list but sometimes you may notice them because they are not displayed as traditional lists.
In HTML, there are three types of lists: unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists. 
<unordered list >
Unordered lists are commonly used in web design, with each item enclosed in an <li> element.
 The entire list is wrapped in an <ul> element, representing an unordered list.
When displayed on browser it appears in bullet points or marker.
The <ul> element defines to the browser what type of list to display and the list appearance can be changed using CSS.
<ordered list >
The ordered list is a type of list with a specific order, unlike the unordered list. 
It uses <ol> to wrap items, indicating a clear order. For example, a recipe can be created with numbered steps.
<definition list>
A definition list in HTML is a key-value pair in computer science, consisting of terms and their corresponding descriptions.
 It uses specific elements, such as <dt> element for terms and <did> element descriptions, and is wrapped in a <dl> element, representing the entire list. 
Multiple descriptions can be added, and the tags are placed side by side.
HTML quotes 
<block quote>
The  <cite> and <blockqoute> elements serve semantic purposes to other computers to inform that the paragraph is quoted.
This elements allow custom styling using CSS .
The blockquote element can contain any element, including paragraphs, lists, or headlines, but it's crucial to ensure elements are nested within each other in a meaningful manner.
< in-line quotes >
The "<q>" element in HTML is used for inline quotes
it automatically provides the appropriate quote marks for different languages. 
Inline elements like <q> are used within a line and they wrap around inline phrases of text.
Block-level elements like block quotes create separate blocks on the page. 
<date time>
Date element
The datetime attribute in HTML allows us to specify a date or time in a machine-readable format
The format must be specific, starting with the year, followed by the month and date. Examples include '2025-05-08'
Time element
The time element is a crucial element in web pages,can be used to  indicate time in a highly standardized format. 
It writes the time in a machine-readable version, including 24-hour clock numbers, seconds, and fractions of a second. 
It also allows specifying the time zone, eg New York City's time zone.
The datetime attribute allows for the combination of date and time, with options for separating them using a T or space. 
This format is acceptable in various programming languages and can be used in various combinations, ensuring time is easily understood by computers.
HTML code
<code elements>
To showcase code on a webpage, use the code element with an opening code tag <code> before the snippet and a closing code tag </code>afterward.
This will display a less than sign  â€œ&lt;" and  "&gt;" will display a greater than sign.
They help display HTML code on a page instead of executing.
These are known as HTML entity.
<bre element>
The br and pre elements are used to add spaces and line breaks to code without affecting the webpage's content.
 For example, if a poem needs to be displayed properly on a webpage, the br element can be added at the end of each line to indicate where a line break should occur. 
This simple tag <br> does not have a closing tag.
<pre element >
for a  poem that  uses irregular spacing to enhance its meaning we is pre element to display it as it is 
We add <pre> tag at the beginning of the poem </pre> at the and of the poem. 
The browser respects spacing, line breaks, and even inserts a random character.
Pre and code elements are combined to display a code block with proper indentation. 
 CSS code is included, wrapped in a code element to indicate a block of code, and wrapped in a pre element to preserve formatting and spacing.
HTML Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text
Subscripts, superscripts, and small text are used to mark specific content with different meanings. 
Subscripts are characters set below the text's normal baseline, like the formula for water, while superscripts are characters set above the text's normal baseline.
Mathematical formulas and footnotes use superscripts, like five squared. 
To mark subscripts and superscripts in HTML, use <sub> and <sup> elements. 
For example, H2O can be formatted as H2O, with the sub-element reducing and the sup element increasing and decreasing.
MathML is a powerful markup language for complex equations on websites.
However, small text, such as copyright information, can still be included in a footer with little prominence. 
To convey this, a small element is used.
CSS can adjust the size of text to be large or small.
Small is correct for conveying small meaning, like strong for importance. 
For example, the fine print at the bottom of a page regarding ownership can be displayed as "It is not the main attraction."
Small, sub, and sup elements are crucial in typography for accurately conveying content's full meaning.
Capabilities 

Troubleshooting and Debugging HTML Code
We can examine HTML in browser developer tools, such as Firefox, to understand a website's code and performance, providing valuable insights into its functionality.
<HTML debugging code>
To access developer tools,opt to go to "tools," then "web developer," and choose "inspector."
The inspector offers a range of tabs with various tools or controls. 
Focus on the left pane, which displays HTML and CSS, and the right pane for layout tools, like CSS changes, and font information.
 The left pane displays the browser's DOM, attempting to correct any mistakes made during the process.
